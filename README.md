## Cars Demo App

This application contains a small api to manage cars. It includes all CRUD functionality and an endpoint to manage metadata.

### Local Development

#### 1. Clone the repo from github.

#### 2. Install all dependencies with the following:

```
   npm install
```

#### 3. Import Postman collection into Postman from ./api/postman folder

#### 4. Add a collection variable to the Cars Demo collection, named "id". Leave this blank for now. You will fill it in later.

#### 5. Run the following:

```
    npm run dev
```

#### 6. Run the POST Car request in Postman and copy the id of the resultant car.

#### 7. Paste the id into the collection variable that you created in Step #4.

#### 8. You should now be able to run all of the other requests in Postman.
